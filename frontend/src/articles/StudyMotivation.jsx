        Staying motivated to study is one of the biggest challenges students
        face. Everyone wants to pass exams, get high grades, and succeed, but
        motivation often disappears after a few days or when topics become
        difficult. The truth is: motivation does not come by magic — it must be
        built and maintained deliberately.

      {/* SECTION 1 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        1. Understand Your “Why”
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Motivation becomes stronger when you know exactly **why** you are
        studying. Ask yourself:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>What future do I want?</li>
        <li>What course do I dream of studying?</li>
        <li>What kind of life do I want in 5–10 years?</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        When your vision is clear, your study sessions become more meaningful.
        You stop reading because someone forced you — you read because **your
        future depends on it**.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 2 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        2. Set Small, Clear, Achievable Goals
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Big goals create fear. Small goals create progress.
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Instead of “study Chemistry today,” say “Finish two topics.”</li>
        <li>Instead of “study for 8 hours,” say “Do 25-minute sessions.”</li>
        <li>
          Instead of “cover the whole Maths syllabus,” say “Master algebra this week.”
        </li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Every time you achieve a small goal, you feel progress — and progress is
        the strongest source of motivation.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 3 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        3. Use the 25-Minute Focus Rule (Pomodoro Technique)
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Long study hours without breaks lead to burnout and boredom. Instead,
        study like this:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Work for 25 minutes</li>
        <li>Take a 5-minute break</li>
        <li>Repeat four cycles</li>
        <li>Take a 15-minute longer break</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        This method increases concentration, reduces mental fatigue, and makes
        studying feel easier and less stressful.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 4 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        4. Remove Distractions (Especially Your Phone)
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Social media notifications are the biggest killers of study motivation.
        During study time:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Turn off your data</li>
        <li>Put your phone in another room</li>
        <li>Use airplane mode</li>
        <li>Use apps that block distractions</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        When distractions disappear, study sessions become smoother and you
        naturally become more focused.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 5 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        5. Study in a Clean and Organized Environment
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        A messy environment = a distracted mind.  
        A clean space = clearer thinking.
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Always study on a clean desk, good lighting, and proper ventilation. A
        calm environment increases motivation and reduces stress.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 6 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        6. Reward Yourself After Studying
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Your brain loves rewards. After completing a study goal:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Eat your favorite snack</li>
        <li>Watch one episode</li>
        <li>Play a game for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Take a short walk</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        When your brain learns that “studying = reward,” your motivation grows
        automatically.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 7 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        7. Use Study Groups or Accountability Partners
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Studying with others increases motivation because it gives you:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Competition</li>
        <li>Support</li>
        <li>Shared goals</li>
        <li>Explanation of difficult concepts</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Even studying with one partner once a week can double your consistency.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 8 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        8. Track Your Progress Weekly
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Motivation grows when you see results. Every Sunday, ask yourself:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>What topics did I finish?</li>
        <li>What topics are left?</li>
        <li>What mistakes did I repeat?</li>
        <li>How can I improve next week?</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Progress tracking prevents discouragement and keeps you disciplined.
      </Typography>

      {/* SECTION 9 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        9. Remove Negative Self-Talk
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Statements like:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>“I’m not good at Maths”</li>
        <li>“I will fail”</li>
        <li>“Others are smarter than me”</li>
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        …destroys motivation. Replace them with:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>“I can improve with practice.”</li>
        <li>“Every day I’m getting better.”</li>
        <li>“I am capable of passing this exam.”</li>
      </Typography>

      {/* ENDING */}
      <Divider sx={{ my: 4 }} />

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
        Motivation is not something you wait for — it is something you build. If
        you understand your goals, remove distractions, use smart study
        techniques, and stay consistent, you will achieve outstanding results in
        any exam.
      </Typography>

      <Typography>
        Stay focused, stay consistent, and keep moving — your success is closer
        than you think.
