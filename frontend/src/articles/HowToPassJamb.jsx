        Passing JAMB is not about reading for long hours — it is about reading
        the **right way**, understanding the **exam pattern**, and practicing
        strategically. JAMB UTME is a Computer-Based Test (CBT), and students who
        practice CBT-style questions consistently perform far better.

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        This complete guide provides a structured, proven strategy used by
        thousands of high-scoring students who achieved **250–320+** in past
        JAMB exams. Follow the principles carefully and you will drastically
        improve your score.

      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        1. Understand the JAMB Exam Structure
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2 }}>
        JAMB tests four subjects: **English Language** (compulsory) plus **three
        subjects related to your course**. Each subject has 40–60 questions,
        totaling about **180–200 questions**.
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        Time is approximately **120 minutes**, meaning you have less than **40
        seconds** per question. This is why speed and familiarity with
        CBT navigation are critical.
      </Typography>

        2. Choose the Correct Subject Combination
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Many students lose admission not because of low scores but due to wrong
        subject combinations. Always check JAMB’s official brochure or use a
        verified subject combination guide.
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 1 }}>
        Examples:
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        3. Study High-Yield Topics First
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        JAMB repeats certain topics every year. Focus on these first before
        reading the entire syllabus.

        4. Create a Weekly Study Timetable
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        You cannot read “everything”. A structured timetable helps you study at a
        realistic pace.

      {/* SECTION 5 */}
      <Typography variant="h4" fontWeight={700} sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
        5. Practice JAMB Past Questions the Right Way
      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        Don’t just read answers — answer questions under exam conditions:
      </Typography>

      <Typography component="ul" sx={{ pl: 3, mb: 3 }}>
        <li>Use a timer</li>
        <li>Don’t guess randomly (negative impact)</li>
        <li>Review skipped or wrong answers immediately</li>
        <li>Track weak topics and repeat them</li>

      </Typography>

      <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 3 }}>
